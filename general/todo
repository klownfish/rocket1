Use a better filtering technique than moving average

estimate velocity and heading

Add gps receiver

figure out a way to transmit the gateways rssi

make the data protocol better, time isn't needed for all messages for example

an easy way to generate the protocol using a common JSON file and meta programming or something
Maybe using python struct and a corresponding library for c++ could be a start.

The len property in the protocol is useless. I could use struct.calcsize() instead

Actually build the rocket
